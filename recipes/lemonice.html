        <h2>Ingredients required:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>2 cups cold milk, chilled</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can nonfat sweetened condensed milk, chilled</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps to make the dish:</h2>
        <pre>Step1:
            In the freezer canister of an ice cream maker, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, milk and sweetened condensed milk. Freeze according to manufacturers' directions.

            Note
            I churned my mixture in my machine for about 15 to 20 minutes, and while still slushy, poured it into individual containers and placed in the freezer for approximately 2 hours. They came out brilliantly, with no ice crystals, not too soft, not too hard and very, very tasty indeed! Enjoy!</pre>

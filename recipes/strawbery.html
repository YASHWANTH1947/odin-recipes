            Making the Base

Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect slices. Toss the berries in sugar until they are completely coated and cook in a 350-degree oven until they are perfectly cooked, slightly caramelized, and overwhelmingly aromatic, about 10 minutes. Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp. Once the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender. Pass the berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the remaining pulp and seeds.

Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum in a small bowl. Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth (don't fret over a few lumps). Stir in the corn syrup. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the strained berry puree and the coconut cream.

Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours.

Churning the Soft Serve

Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft serve, about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine. Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe the ice cream out into a cone! This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to two weeks but should be very tediously tempered before eating after being frozen.

The Science-y Way to Make Soft Serve: Dry Ice

The experts at Seattle-based food and technology company ChefSteps favor another approach to making soft serve ice cream: using dry ice. By mashing the dry ice and slowly adding it into an ice cream base in your blender, the home cook can keep the ice cream as smooth and soft as that found in restaurants. The key, according to ChefSteps, is to build a network of ice crystals that are as small as possible, by freezing the mix quickly, while it's in motion. "This is why using super-cold liquid nitrogen or the more easily sourced dry ice results in a much better ice cream than is possible with most home ice cream machines, which simply cannot remove enough heat energy fast enough to quickly freeze the mix."
